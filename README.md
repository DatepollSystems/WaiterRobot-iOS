# WaiterRobot iOS

## Getting started
This project uses xcodegen for generating the xCode project.

1. If not installed, you can install xcode gen using brew:
```bash
brew install xcodegen
```

2. Generate the xcode project (run in root folder, where the `project.yml` lives):
```bash
xcodegen
```
This command must also be run after switching branches and it's advisable to also run it after a `git pull`

3. Open the `WaiterRobot.xcodeproj` in xCode and start coding :)
